                <p>This game is a well known word game, especialy for Kosovans who watch
                    Oxygen Show.
                </p>
                <p>The rules of the game are simple. <label for="images">First
                        let me show you how the app looks:
                    </label></p>
                        <div id="images" class="images">
                    <div onclick="imageClick(event)" class="img"><img src="./example1.png" alt="example pic"></div>
                    <div onclick="imageClick(event)" class="img"><img src="./example2.png" alt="example pic"></div>
                </div>
                <p>As you can tell, the game board consists of four columns, each of which have four
                    words and final solution at the bottom. The column solution is a word that
                    connects in some way or another with each of the words above it.
                </p>
                <p>The final word is derived from the four column solutions and follows the same rule: It is
                    connected somehow with those four column solutions.
                </p>
                <p>This was a very fun project to work on and gave me a lot of challenges that helped me get
                    better at DOM manipulation.
                </p>
                <p>Although, for the moment, has only one level, I definitely plan on adding a lot more
                    since it is fun for me and I see it being used by groups of friend who want to have a
                    good time playing some word games.
                </p>
