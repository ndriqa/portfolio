                <p>AgeApp is a site where you can see some fun stats for your age</p>
                <p>One of the stats, for example, being "How old would you be in other planets" since
                    other planets' revolution around the Sun differs from that of the Earth
                    (talking about the time it takes the planet to finish it).
                </p>
                <p>This project is one of the easiest since the problem it provides and the solving method it takes
                    is pretty straight forward:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>You take the birth date</li>
                    <li>Calculate the age in days</li>
                    <li>Divide the age with the days it takes the other planet to circle around the Sun</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, it was an easy project overall, but I did it since it was a good exercise
                    to test out some DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
                </p>
