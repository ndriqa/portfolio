                <p>This cool project idea is a modified version of the concept shown
                    <a class="reference" href="#link1">in the video linked at the end of this document</a>.
                    (not my video)
                </p>
                <p>I've done a detailed explanation on how it works, about 2 years ago, in my old 
                    <a class="reference" href="#link2">blogspot post</a>.
                </p>
                <p>The logic behind the beautiful view created by the app is pretty simple.</p>
                <label for="images">First, let's see what we are talking about here:</label>
                <div id="images" class="images">
                    <div onclick="imageClick(event)" class="img"><img src="./example.gif" alt="example pic"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Now, here is the basic structure I had in mind while writing this app.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Write the droplet class</li>
                    <li>Create a canvas</li>
                    <li>Add thousands of droplets in the canvas</li>
                    <li>Update the position of each droplet every 10 milliseconds</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That's it.</p>
                <p>Once the app design is finished, writing the code is very easy.</p>
                <p>What I did different is that I added some new fields to the droplet class
                    like <strong>width</strong> and <strong>speed</strong> so I could give the droplets
                    a depth perception by drawing them as rectangles and not as lines, and set the falling speed accordingly 
                    so it appears as if the bigger droplets(those that look like they are in front) are falling faster 
                    than those in the back.
                </p>
                <p>If you try this project I'd recommend trying something different, for example add 
                    <strong>horizontal speed</strong> and make the droplets slide a bit to the side to imitate
                    the wind pushing them.
                </p>
                <p>Anyway, this is an old project so keep in mind that it is not as efficient as I would make it now.
                    One of the changes I would make is that I would use Timer class to control the fps of the animation
                    and not the <strong><em>Thread.sleep()</em></strong> since the sleep() method of Thread class is not
                    meant for this kind of things.
                </p>
